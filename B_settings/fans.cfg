# PSA:
# If you get a mosquito hotend and use the mosquito-provided fan, you will notice that it makes an absolutely ungodly amount of noise. Here's how you can fix it:
#  [heater_fan hotend_fan]
#  cycle_time:0.025
#  fan_speed:0.99
#  heater:extruder
#  heater_temp:50.0
#  kick_start_time:0.5
#  max_power:1.0
#  pin:PC6
# You may be able to improve it further (more speed without much more noise) by further fiddling with cycle_time and fan_speed.
